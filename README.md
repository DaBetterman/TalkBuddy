## Architecture

BuddyTalk follows a simple, yet effective architecture:

### Frontend
- **Voice Input Interface**: Allows users to interact using voice commands.
- **Forms & Buttons**: Provides an alternative way to interact via text or buttons when voice isnâ€™t feasible.

### Backend
- **Flask Application**: Handles HTTP requests and manages routes such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting events. It also serves the frontend static files.
- **Google Calendar API**: Directly communicates with the Google Calendar to fetch or manipulate event data.
- **Speech-to-Text Processing**: Converts voice commands into actionable text using SpeechRecognition.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Communicates responses back to the user using Pyttsx3 for voice output.

### External Integrations
- **Google Calendar API**: Centralized to manage and manipulate events.
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secures user access to their Google Calendar data.
